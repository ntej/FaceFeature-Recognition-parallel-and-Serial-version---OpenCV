Face Features Extraction using Haar feature- based cascade classifiers. Implemented in serial and parallel version

Serial and parallel version code for the extraction of face features from the frontal human face images. For the face detection and extraction of features we used Haar feature based cascade classifiers for the object detection . Open CV comes with a trainer as well as detector, we adopted Open CV already per-trained classifiers for detecting the face/faces and for extracting eyes, mouth and nose form the detected face/faces.
